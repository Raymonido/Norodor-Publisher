        <h1>About our project</h1>
    </div>
   
    <p>As mentioned on the Homepage, Norodor was made as a school project and wasn't intended to be a real game. Norodor is a simple, straightforward jump and run game that harkens back to the genre's roots, offering an uncomplicated yet engaging gaming experience. Without the frills of modern titles, it focuses on the joy of pure gameplay, where you control a character navigating through a series of levels with increasing difficulty.

        In this game, the emphasis is on timing and precision. <br><br>Each jump and run through the minimalist landscapes presents its own set of challenges, encouraging players to improve their skills as they progress. While Norodor may lack the complex features found in other games, its simplicity is its charm, appealing to both beginners and those looking for a nostalgic gaming session.
        Though it might not boast an array of features, Norodor's simplicity is by design, ensuring that players can dive right in without needing to learn complicated controls or mechanics. It's a game that proves sometimes, less is more, inviting players to enjoy a straightforward adventure through its serene and uncomplicated world.</p>

       <p><br><br><br>The Controls to play Norodor are as follows: <br><br>Walk --> A/D or ArrowLeft/ArrowRight <br><br> Jump --> Space <br><br> Crouch --> S or ArrowDown <br><br> Shoot --> Control
